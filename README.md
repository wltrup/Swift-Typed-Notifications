## What ##

I recently watched some of the excellent [**Swift Talk**](https://talk.objc.io)
episodes and two, in particular, got me thinking in a different direction than
what they suggest in those talks. I'm speaking of **typed notifications**.

If you haven't watched them, you should. Actually, you should watch the entire
series because there's a lot of good stuff there.

## The problem ##

If you have done much iOS development, especially in the olden days of
Objective-C, you'll have noticed that a lot of it is very much "stringly" typed,
that is, a lot of things are determined by strings (`NSString` instances).
Notifications are no exception and, in fact, are one of the more annoying
examples. Not only the notification names are strings that you could
accidentally mistype but the user-info dictionary is, well, a dictionary that
can contain anything, of any object type. Upon receiving a notification, you
have to make sure that everything in it has the expected type and then you do a
lot of casting. That's very error-prone and there has to be a better, more
**swifty**, way to handle all that.

## My solution ##

I propose that you can define your custom notifications (and even wrap the
system ones) as cases of an enumerated type satisfying a particular protocol.
Here's an example of how you'd go about defining and using some silly custom
notifications:

```Swift
// Defining your custom notifications:
enum MyAppNotifs: NotificationEnum {

    case appHasLaunched(launchDate: Date)
    case appDownloadedData(title: String, index: Int)
    case appWillCrash(error: Error)

    var name: Notification.Name {
        switch self {
        case .appHasLaunched(_):
            return MyAppNotifs.appHasLaunchedNotif
        case .appDownloadedData(_, _):
            return MyAppNotifs.appDownloadedDataNotif
        case .appWillCrash(_):
            return MyAppNotifs.appWillCrashNotif
        }
    }

    static let appHasLaunchedNotif    = Notification.Name(rawValue: "MyAppNotifs.appHasLaunched")
    static let appDownloadedDataNotif = Notification.Name(rawValue: "MyAppNotifs.appDownloadedData")
    static let appWillCrashNotif      = Notification.Name(rawValue: "MyAppNotifs.appWillCrash")

}


// This is how an interested party would subscribe to receive notifications of a particular kind and case:
// (The token is an object you store --- say, in your view controller --- so that when the view controller
//  goes out of scope, the observer gets automatically removed from the notification center)
var token = center.addObserver(name: MyAppNotifs.appDownloadedDataNotif) {
    (notification: MyAppNotifs, object: Any?) in

    switch notification {
    case .appDownloadedData(let title, let index):
        print("title: \(title), index: \(index)")
    default:
        break
    }

}

// This is how a notification is posted. I think this reads particularly nicely.
let notif = MyAppNotifs.appDownloadedData(title: "Test", index: 5)
center.post(notification: notif)
```
